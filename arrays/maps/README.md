#### MAPS

Maps are a data structure that allows you to store `key-value pairs`. They are useful when you want to associate values with specific keys.

- A map is an unordered and channgeable collection that does not allow duplicate keys.
- The default value of a map is `nil`.

#### MAKE FUNCTION

When you create a variable like `users := []string{}`, without specifying the size of the items it can hold, it is a `slice` not an `array`.
